## What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, the main idea is to manipulate MongoDB CRUD operations.

1. Create a database called "contact".
2. Create a collection called "contactlist".
3. Insert these documents in "contactlist":
   - Last name: Ben, First name: Moris, Email: ben@gmail.com, Age: 26
   - Last name: Kefi, First name: Seif, Email: kefi@gmail.com, Age: 15
   - Last name: Emilie, First name: Brouge, Email: emilie.b@gmail.com, Age: 40
   - Last name: Alex, First name: Brown, Age: 4
   - Last name: Denzel, First name: Washington, Age: 3

## Instructions

1. Display all of the contacts list.
2. Display all the information about only one person using their ID.
3. Display all the contacts with an age > 18.
4. Display all the contacts with an age > 18 and name containing "ah".
5. Change the contact's first name from "Kefi Seif" to "Kefi Anis".
6. Delete the contacts that are aged under 5.
7. Display all of the contacts list.

**NB:** You have to save your work as screenshots.
